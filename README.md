# what versatileAnn is

While developing machine learning models can be time-consuming, even the smallest typos in programming can derail months of hard work, rendering unreliable results. Utilizing `well-tested tools` can significantly improve the experience of both using and developing models.

This project aims to provide utility tools that streamline the development of models, particularly those in the realm of deep learning. As the name `"VersatileAnn"` suggests, the project strives to be beneficial across different deep learning subfields, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, forecasting, and other more general use cases. Not only can it be useful for people to `simply try out some models`, but it's designated to be especially handy for `AI researchers` who require a robust and efficient development environment.

The project comprises four distinct sections: `dataPrep`, `brazingTorch`, `models`, and `machineLearning`. `BrazingTorch` and `machineLearning` offer valuable resources for individuals aspiring to delve into development and utilizing deep learning and machine learning approaches, respectively.

However, the dataPrep and models sections are currently `specialized` for `forecasting` containing many of its `state of the art` models. It's worth noting that NLP falls under the category of models dealing with sequential data, where information is processed in a specific order. This alignment allows VersatileAnn to be particularly useful for NLP tasks. The project holds potential for incorporating novel ideas similar to the existing ones, but these are yet to be implemented for other subfields.

Additionally, VersatileAnn aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for testing various machine learning models with different hyperparameters. This functionality can significantly save development time and effort by streamlining the process of identifying the optimal configuration for a specific model.
