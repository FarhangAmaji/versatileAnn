# current

todos:

    - add regularization features
    - check soleymanis errors?!?!
    - 
    - make test for addTests of lossNRegularization
    - check when both of forwardOutputs and targets are tensor in _warnIf_forwardOutputsNTargets_haveNoSamePattern
    - self.lossFuncs should be always True or not:
            if its not necessary I should addTest for working example with no self.lossFuncs
    - final resetModel args with should be used from init args so current state of model
    - make test for resetModel
    - make preRunTests logs as I want
